InfluxDB can display statistical and diagnostic information about each node.
This information can be very useful for troubleshooting and performance monitoring.

## SHOW STATS
To see node stats execute the command `SHOW STATS`.
An example is shown below.

```sql
SHOW STATS
```

```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "series": [
                {
                    "name": "server",
                    "columns": [
                        "broadcastMessageRx",
                        "batchWriteRx",
                        "pointWriteRx",
                        "writeSeriesMessageTx"
                    ],
                    "values": [
                        [
                            37
                        ],
                        [
                            299984
                        ],
                        [
                            2789
                        ],
                        [
                            25
                        ]
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The statistics returned by `SHOW STATS` are stored in memory only, and are reset to zero when the node is restarted.

## SHOW DIAGNOSTICS
To see node diagnostics execute the command `SHOW DIAGNOSTICS`.
This returns information such as build information, uptime, hostname, server configuration, memory usage, and Go runtime diagnostics.

## Internal Monitoring
InfluxDB also writes statistical and diagnostic information to database named `_internal`, which records metrics on the internal runtime and service performance.
The `_internal` database can be queried and manipulated like any other InfluxDB database.
Check out the [monitor service README](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/blob/master/monitor/README.md) and the [internal monitoring blog post](https://influxdb.com/blog/2015/09/22/monitoring_internal_show_stats.html) for more detail.
