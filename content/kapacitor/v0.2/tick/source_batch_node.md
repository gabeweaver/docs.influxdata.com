A node that handles creating several child BatchNodes.
Each call to `query` creates a child batch node that 
can further be configured.
See [BatchNode](/kapacitor/v0.2/tick/batch_node/) 
The `batch` variable in batch tasks is an instance of 
a [SourceBatchNode.](/kapacitor/v0.2/tick/source_batch_node/) 

Example: 

```javascript
     var errors = batch
                      .query('SELECT value from errors')
                      ...
var views = batch
                      .query('SELECT value from views')
                      ...
```

Chaining Methods
----------------

Chaining methods create a new node in the pipeline as a child of the calling node.
They do not modify the calling node.

### Query

The query to execute.
Must not contain a time condition 
in the `WHERE` clause or contain a `GROUP BY` clause.
The time conditions are added dynamically according to the period, offset and schedule.
The `GROUP BY` clause is added dynamically according to the dimensions 
passed to the `groupBy` method.


```javascript
node.query(q string)
```

Returns: [BatchNode](/kapacitor/v0.2/tick/batch_node/)
